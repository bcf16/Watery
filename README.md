This app is designed for the main purpose of accurate water detection of lakes anywhere in the world. It fuses Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images of various pre-selected ROIs around the world, trains a random forest classifier on these and then classifies a new fused image within an ROI selected by the user. Selectable dates allow the user to automatically create a single image through median filtering of all available images between these dates. A new image of fused data from S1 and S2 median images will then be classified within the selected ROI. 5 landcover classes are used, these being Water, Urban, Vegetation, Bare and Snow. Non-water classes exist for extra detail but are not necessarily accurate. A knowledge filter is also included to exclude the snow class from the classification process based on user preference. https://bencamforsyth.users.earthengine.app/
